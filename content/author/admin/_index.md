I'm is a Senior Research Scientist at [SDAIA](https://sdaia.gov.sa/en/default.aspx). I obtained my Ph.D. from `Nanyang Technological University (NTU)` advised by [Prof. Dr. Shafiq Joty](https://raihanjoty.github.io/). My research objective is to develop deep models that have the notion of humanity. I spend a huge amount of time and effort exploring unsupervised training and their potential contribution to the generalizability and distributional shift of the language model (LM).At the core of my work, I investigate distribution shifts between training and inference data and explore how we can address this distributional shift using various methods, such as semi-supervised learning, multitask discrete prompting, data distillation, and model distillation.. Additionally, I was a key contributor to the BLOOM architecture, training and prompt engineering working group. I love tooling, debugging and training large language models.
