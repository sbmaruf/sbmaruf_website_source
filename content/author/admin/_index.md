I am `M Saiful Bari`. You may also call me `Maruf`. I am a doctoral candidate at NTU, Singapore. My supervisor is [Prof. Dr. Shafiq Joty](https://raihanjoty.github.io/). My research objective is to develop deep models that have the notion of humanity (brain motivated). I spend a huge amount of time and effort exploring unsupervised training and their potential contribution to the generalizability and distributional shift of the language model (LM). In my early work, I investigated adversarial training and semi-supervised learning to transfer knowledge from a high resource to a low resource language. My recent work largely involves efficient transductive few-shot inference and parameter efficient multitask inference via prompt tuning. At the core of my work, I investigate distribution shifts between training vs inference data and how we can solve this distributional shift using various methods (i.e., semi-supervised learning, multitask discrete prompting, data distillation, model distillation). I love tooling, debugging and training large language models.
